# LibraryLink Utilities API Reference

**LibraryLink Utilities** (abbr. LLU) is a set of modern C++ wrappers over most parts of *LibraryLink* - the Wolfram Language framework for connecting
to C/C++ libraries. LLU started as an internal Wolfram project which can now be used as a stand-alone library and is available publicly on GitHub.

The following site contains [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) documentation automatically generated from the source code comments.
It is intended to serve both users and developers of LLU therefore internal functions are often documented too. 

Doxygen documentation covers the entire API and is great when you know what to look for. Before you dive into detailed description of specific 
functions and classes it is recommended to read the tutorial-like introduction to LLU, which can be found here:

https://wolframresearch.github.io/LibraryLinkUtilities/

The linked document contains general overview, build instructions and different sections for each core part of LLU. 
Every section provides examples and description of related C++ entities.
